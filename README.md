# ADXL_calibration
###### The purpose of these scripts is to test and calibrate the threshold for the ADXL345 accelerometers. Testing was conducted on a vibration sampler. The script will read in values from the accelerometers as given sampling rates based on the given vibration frequency on the test machine.

### Use ###
1. Clone or download the repo onto the RaspBerry Pi that will be attatched to the ADXL345 chips.
2. Make sure the chips are connected to the Pi as instructed on their manual.
3. Run the code using Python 3. Change the values of the threads as needed for calibrating or testing.
