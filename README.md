# ADXL_calibration
###### The purpose of these scripts is to test and calibrate the threshold for the ADXL345 accelerometers. Testing was conducted on a vibration sampler. The script will read in values from the accelerometers as given sampling rates based on the given vibration frequency on the test machine.
